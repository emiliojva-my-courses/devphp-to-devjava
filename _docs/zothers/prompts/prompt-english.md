English Corrections and Explanations

1. Original: "Can you analises my exercise of the 'variables and types'?"
   Correction: "Can you analyze my exercise on 'variables and types'?"
   Note: Use "analyze" (verb) instead of "analises" (noun). "On" is more natural than "of" in this context.

2. Original: "how can we go to next exercise?"
   Correction: "How can I move on to the next exercise?"
   Note: "Move on to" is the correct phrasal verb. Use "I" for personal questions.

3. Parentheses note:
   If you start your question with parentheses, it means you want help with English. I will always correct and explain your question.

General Tips:
- Use "Can you..." for requests.
- Use "How can I..." for asking about steps or instructions.
- Use "exercise on..." to specify the topic.
